## Map Of Content for Obsidian

This plugin helps you set up your vault in a decentralized manner, where every note is connected to a central note through different other notes, just like files in folders that are in other folders, except through links. 

It will find the shortest path from the central note to the currently open note and display it. It will also display the notes that can best be reached through the current note (it's descendants) and their descendants.

It can generate a complete Map of Content that you can use to navigate your vault from any note you open, and updating it to show changes that you've made to your notes is blazing fast.

If you have the notes "Central Note", "Animals", "Mammals", "Cats", "Dogs" and "Kittens", and you open "Mammals", it will look like this:

This Map of Content will be displayed in the plugin pane, right of the editor.  

You can choose which note should be at the center of your vault in the settings tab.

When you make changes to your notes, you need to rebuild the map of content by clicking on the icon in the sidebar or executing the command from the command palette. This shouldn't take more than a second, even if you have thousands of notes.


Here's another example:
