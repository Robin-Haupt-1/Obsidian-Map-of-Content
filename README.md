## Map Of Content for Obsidian

With this plugin, you will always know exactly where you are in your vault and how all of your notes are connected to each other. It helps you organize your notes in a decentralized manner, where every note is connected to a central note through different other notes, just like files in folders that are in other folders, except through links. 

It will find the shortest path from the central note to the currently open note and display it. It will also display the notes that are hierarchically below the current note (it's descendants) and their descendants.

Because it generates this information from the links in your notes, the structure stays flexible and can adapt to any changes you make to your links.

This Map of Content will be displayed in the plugin pane, right of the editor. You can choose which note should be at the center of your vault in the settings tab.

When you make changes to your notes, the Map of Content will be updated automatically when you switch between notes. You can also trigger the update by clicking on the little sync icon in the top bar.

Here's another example of what the view can look like if you have a lot of notes:
