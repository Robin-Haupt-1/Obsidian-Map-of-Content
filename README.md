## Top Level Indexer (Obsidian Plugin)

I'm working on creating a plugin for Obsidian.md to analyze each note's relationship within a semantic context, all centering around one "Top Level Index" note.

The goal is to create a tool to sort all the user's notes in a way that is both hierachical and flexible. It's a modern implementation of the classic Zettelkasten prefix system used by Niklas Luhmann.
